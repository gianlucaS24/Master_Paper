The Supplementary Material indicated in the paper reports all plots used in the paper plus all those plots that could not fit the limited number of pages dedicated to this work. 
We refer to the classical one-component profile as "simple Sérsic profile", whereas "single Sérsic profile" indicates a one-source fit and "multi-source Sérsic profile" for a multiple source fit.
For a single Sérsic profile the profile type may not be simple and will specified case by case.
The .zip file with name " all_SEDs_Chi_50+residuals+plots " contains { residual plots + asdf files + corner plots } for various pysersic profiles, comprising:
 - single Sérsic profile with masking (labelled "_single"),
- multi-source (simple) Sérsic profile with and without (as used in the paper) masking ("_multisource" and "_multisource_small", respectively) and 
- bulge-disk decomposition (indicated as "_bulge" files) with single Sérsic profile and masking.
In the zip files are also present the SEDs. All those selected with UVJ box + mass cut + chi square cut are present and the "good" ones in a separate inner folder called "good_SED", the latter analyzed with pysersic.
