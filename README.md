This repository has been created to show the work I have been committed to during my Master's Thesis. The paper resulting from it will be available before the 30th of October if it is in a decent form for presentation.
The core of the thesis is the pipeline, built about two main functionalities of pysersic, that the reader can find named as "DTUwHPC_CalcSizeTest_hom.ipynb". It is a customable notebook suitable for direct submission to a High Performance Computer (HPC), so far only tested on DTU's HPC.
By "customable" it is meant that everyone can modify and improve it, not having any rigid logic that cannot adapt to the user's need. It is suited for reading data from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA), and possible caveats are noted in the notebook itself. It is made primarily for studying the morphology of quiescent galaxies, but the application can extend beyond. The author itself has used and extended it upon need.
I can hardly believe that a definitive, powerful code can sensibly exist, especially for such varied application like studying morphology, assessing significance of parameters etc... Any futher information or extension about how the modelling works can be found in the pysersic repository at https://pysersic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ .
Not all functionalities of pysersic have been implemented, mainly because some of them are specific enough to allow for the user to custom the code and implement them by itself.
